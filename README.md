## Hello there (In Obi-wan Kenobi voice) ðŸ‘‹

I am Ansarul, but most people know me as Sohan.\
Recently finished my Master's in Programming & System Architecture at the University of Oslo, where I researched energy-efficient cloud deployments.
I am a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient systems. I have experience in various programming languages and frameworks, and I love to learn new technologies.

- My thesis was titled ""Energy Efficiency in Cloud Deployments: An empirical evaluation of energy efficiency in Containers and Unikernels"".
- I am proficient in JavaScript, Some Python, and C#. I have worked with Node.js, React, mongoDB, Express and PostgreSQL.
- I am currently learning about .Net core and exploring the world of cloud computing and microservices. Besides, I am also interested in Advanced DSA and ML.

- Fun fact: I am a huge fan of Star Wars and Marvel Cinematic Universe. I love to watch movies and series in my free time. I also enjoy playing video games, especially games with good storylines and graphics. Nothing beats a good story, right?
- Another fun fact: I am an anime nerd. I love watching anime, but sometimes I cannot wait for the next episodes to come out, and end up reading the manga instead. Big fan of Attack on Titan, My hero Academia and Solo Leveling(Manhwa is better than the anime, fight me on this).
